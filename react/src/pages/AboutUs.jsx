      <p className="mb-4">
        At Rawhide Leathers, we are passionate artisans dedicated to the timeless art of leather craftsmanship.
        Our journey began with a vision to blend tradition and innovation, creating leather accessories that are both
        functional and exquisitely beautiful. We specialize in 100% handmade products that reflect a deep respect for
        authenticity, quality, and sustainability.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We began with a simple idea: to craft timeless pieces that honor the rich heritage of leatherworking while embracing
        modern design sensibilities. Every item we create is more than just an accessory—it’s a statement of enduring
        elegance and meticulous craftsmanship.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our team of skilled artisans brings decades of experience to every piece, working with precision and care to ensure
        the highest standards of quality. We source only the finest, ethically produced leather, focusing on sustainable and
        responsible practices that respect both the environment and the communities we work with.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        From wallets and belts to bags and keychains, every item is thoughtfully designed and crafted to tell its own
        unique story. The attention to detail in each stitch and cut reflects our belief that true beauty lies in the details.
        Our accessories are not just products—they are heirlooms, designed to accompany you on your journey and age gracefully
        over time.
